# Title

*This is an description*

## Installation

1. Install requirements

```
pip install mlflow
```

## Usage

1. Start server
```
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```
2. Configuring the MLflow Tracking Client
```
client = MlflowClient(tracking_uri="http://127.0.0.1:8080")
```
3. Create experiment
```
# Provide an Experiment description that will appear in the UI
experiment_description = (
    "This is the grocery forecasting project. "
    "This experiment contains the produce models for apples."
)

# Provide searchable tags that define characteristics of the Runs that
# will be in this Experiment
experiment_tags = {
    "project_name": "grocery-forecasting",
    "store_dept": "produce",
    "team": "stores-ml",
    "project_quarter": "Q3-2023",
    "mlflow.note.content": experiment_description,
}

# Create the Experiment, providing a unique name
produce_apples_experiment = client.create_experiment(
    name="Apple_Models", tags=experiment_tags
)
```

```
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:8080")
```

```
# Sets the current active experiment to the "Apple_Models" experiment and
# returns the Experiment metadata
apple_experiment = mlflow.set_experiment("Apple_Models")

# Define a run name for this iteration of training.
# If this is not set, a unique name will be auto-generated for your run.
run_name = "apples_rf_test"

# Define an artifact path that the model will be saved to.
artifact_path = "rf_apples"

```

```
# Split the data into features and target and drop irrelevant date field and target field
X = data.drop(columns=["date", "demand"])
y = data["demand"]

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

params = {
    "n_estimators": 100,
    "max_depth": 6,
    "min_samples_split": 10,
    "min_samples_leaf": 4,
    "bootstrap": True,
    "oob_score": False,
    "random_state": 888,
}

# Train the RandomForestRegressor
rf = RandomForestRegressor(**params)

# Fit the model on the training data
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the validation set
y_pred = rf.predict(X_val)

# Calculate error metrics
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_val, y_pred)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
r2 = r2_score(y_val, y_pred)

# Assemble the metrics we're going to write into a collection
metrics = {"mae": mae, "mse": mse, "rmse": rmse, "r2": r2}

# Initiate the MLflow run context
with mlflow.start_run(run_name=run_name) as run:
    # Log the parameters used for the model fit
    mlflow.log_params(params)

    # Log the error metrics that were calculated during validation
    mlflow.log_metrics(metrics)

    # Log an instance of the trained model for later use
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(
        sk_model=rf, input_example=X_val, artifact_path=artifact_path
    )
